title: Never compromise on quality

I'm currently reading the classic book "Peopleware".
I've never really read books on management before, so it's
interesting to read about stuff that I've previously only
noticed by doing on the job.

One of the chapters is on quality and how you should
never compromise on quality. The idea is that most programmers
are proud of their work and if you pressure them to
lower their quality you will lower their morale. Lowered morale
means that people quite and replacing people is very expensive.

As a convincing example, they mention that Japan is by many considered
to be famous for their high quality on anything they produce.
At the same time, they are also famous for being productive. 
So there isn't necessarily a tradeoff between quality and
productivity. 

Interestingly this is something I've noticed first hand.
Both how productivity has increased by having a zero
tolerance on bugs because it eliminates most support
tickets. But also how morale can plummet when programmers
are being told to lower their quality standard.
