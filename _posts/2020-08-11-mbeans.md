As most of the stuff in the enterprise Java world, MBeans has a cryptic
name. What it does is provides a backdoor into your application. 

The MBean is the class which provides those operations to expose,
and the backdoor is opened by the program JConsole over JMX.
JConsole is bundled along with the JDK.

As usual, this is probably easiest to explain with an example. 
The example uses Spring which makes the boilerplate a little
easier. Using POJO isn't much harder though, but this post won't
describe those details.

```java
@Component
@ManagedResource
@Slf4j
public class HelloService {
    private String name = "World";

    @ManagedOperation
    public void managedHello() {
        log.info("Hello {}!", name);
    }

    @ManagedAttribute
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    @ManagedAttribute
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

The method 'managedHello' can be invoked from JConsole and the
attribute 'name' can be changed from JConsole. 

This is, of course, a useless example. But it showcases the potential
of MBeans.

As it turns out, Spring is already exposing the actuator operations
as MBeans. You might need to put "spring.jmx.enabled=true" in your
properties for it to be activated though.

A typical setup might be to expose your REST endpoints over HTTP on
a port reachable by the Internet. And to expose JMX on a different
port reachable from your office net. Then you can expose sensitive
operations as MBeans that will only be reachable from your office.
