It is important to remember why a task is performed. I've seen
a lot of programmers that focus too much on the what and the how.
It doesn't matter what technology is used or how efficient
the solution is if it doesn't solve any problem.

George H. Heilmeier was a director at DARPA in the seventies.
He created a set of questions to be used at DARPA to evaluate
what research projects to attempt:

* What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
* How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
* What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
* Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
* What are the risks and the payoffs?
* How much will it cost?
* How long will it take?
* What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

While originally intended for research projects, I think most of
the questions fit quite well for software development projects.
