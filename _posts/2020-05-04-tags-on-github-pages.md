I recently added tags to my GitHub pages (i.e. the page you're currently viewing).
I mostly copied it from [mindust.com](http://www.minddust.com/post/alternative-tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/) so I figured I should give that page 
a shoutout.

If you want it for your page you can head over to Minddust and read for yourselves.
I choose only to add tags support, as I felt the need for the category 
distinction superfluous. If you want to copy my solution you can check out this
commit [f676ccb31800251f479ef6c13dab14d0e7048adc](https://github.com/plilja/plilja.github.io/commit/f676ccb31800251f479ef6c13dab14d0e7048adc).
